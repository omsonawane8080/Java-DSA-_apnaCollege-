1. Conditional Statements ‘if-else’
The if block is used to specify the code to be executed if the condition specified  in if is true, the else block is executed otherwise.

int age = 30;
if(age > 18) {
   System.out.println("This is an adult");
} else {
   System.out.println("This is not an adult");
}

2. Conditional Statements ‘switch’
Switch case statements are a substitute for long if statements that compare a
variable to multiple values. After a match is found, it executes the
corresponding code of that value case.

The following example is to print days of the week:

int n = 1;
switch(n) {
   case 1 :
       System.out.println("Monday");
       break;
   case 2 :
       System.out.println("Tuesday");
       break;
   case 3 :
       System.out.println("Wednesday");
       break;
   case 4 :
       System.out.println("Thursday");
       break;
   case 5:
       System.out.println("Friday");
       break;
   case 6 :
       System.out.println("Saturday");
       break;
   default :
       System.out.println("Sunday");
}



Homework Problems
1. Make a Calculator. Take 2 numbers (a & b) from the user and an operation as follows : 
	1 : + (Addition) a + b
    2 : - (Subtraction) a - b
    3 : * (Multiplication) a * b
    4 : / (Division) a / b
    5 : % (Modulo or remainder) a % b
     Calculate the result according to the operation given and display it to the user.

2. Ask the user to enter the number of the month & print the name of the month. For eg - For ‘1’ print ‘January’, ‘2’ print ‘February’ & so on.
